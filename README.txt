Progress:
-print out usage messages and error: ok for default, not same as testcases
-draw structure of canvas: restart button, grid, and label score 
-Click tile => change to picture => disappear

NEED FIX:
-click outside => get the closest tile, may need to change the method find_closest => sth else
-click many time => out of bound: need another array
